Howdy! And welcome to my tech and life blog - **_TechFlip_**. This is my first post. I decided to start this blog for many reasons. Here's a few.

## Why did I start?

**A New Challenge.** I spend a lot of time writing code. I currently am a Software Engineer Intern in Austin, Texas. I also am still a student at Texas A&M University (Whoop!). I have noticed that my time within my job or school work is focused on engineering and designing. So, I figured I'd venture into an untapped space for myself.

**Blogs have helped me.** I am an aspiring software engineer, however, I am not obtaining a computer science degree. Most of my coding experience has been learning through tutorials (_where are my todo app people at?_), creating projects for myself, and... blogs. I figured, if blogs can help me, maybe I can help others.

**Accountability.** I have secretly always wanted to start a blog, but constantly created excuses not to. _No one will read it._ _I'm not a good writer._ _I don't have time._ The list goes on and on. So, I decided to make it a public and share it with my friends and family. I know myself. If I tell others, I have a bigger incentive to follow there. So, here I am!

## What are the benefits?

**Teaching = Learning.** It's not quite as simple as that, but it is fairly true. I have found that when I teach something I have to _really_ know the content. Score! I'm always wanting to learn but in the constant cycle of going from topic to topic. A blog is the perfect place to hone in on specific topics and follow through with learning.

**Growing as an individual.** As I stated before, I tend to code, code, and then code some more when it comes to school and work. I wanted to expand my skills beyond just the technical aspects. Writing allows me to explore a new are of creativeness and grow as an individual.

**Helping others.** This is probably why I wanted to start this blog the most. When started my journey of learning to code I spent a lot of time Googling. That lead me to many blog posts that explained simple and complex topics. The time authors have spent have absolutely contributed to my success as a developer. I want to give back. Even if I only help one person, it's totally worth it.

## Conclusion

I am starting a new blog about all things tech and life. My goal is to learn as much as a I can and enjoy it along the way. I would love for you to join me on this journey.
